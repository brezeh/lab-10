First I did import string so that it would print the string when I ran the program
Then I made a helper function to ignore spaces, punctation, and the letter case
Then I made the recursive function to check if the string is a palindrome
Then I made another recursive function to count vowels and consonants in the string
Then I made a function to analyze the string to check if the string is a palindrome and if it has more vowels than consonants
